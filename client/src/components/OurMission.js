                    A 2012 report from the National Endowment for the Arts showed that, by nearly every indicator studied, a student from a low-socioeconomic (SES) background with a high-arts educational experience significantly outperformed peers from a low-arts, low-SES background, closing (and in some cases eliminating) the gap that often appears between low-SES students and their more advantaged peers.

                    The arts don’t just impact standardized test scores, though the report does show, for example, that low-SES eighth grade students who have a history of high arts engagement have higher science and writing scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) than those who do not. Such high school students had better GPAs than their low-arts, low-SES peers (and in some instances, than all students). But I was more impressed with some of the other outcomes the study showed. Consider:
                <ol className="is-upper-roman">
                        <li> <strong>High-arts, low-SES students were more likely to graduate than low-arts, low-SES students -- and all students </strong>: Only 4 percent of high-arts, low-SES students did not graduate from high school, compared to 22 percent of low-arts, low-SES students -- and 7 percent of students overall (though the latter difference does not appear to be statistically significant)</li>
                        <li> <strong>High-arts, low-SES students were more likely to both attend and finish college than low-arts, low-SES students</strong>: 71 percent of high-arts, low-SES students attended college after high school, compared to 48 percent of low-arts, low-SES students; 18 percent of high-arts, low-SES students who started college achieved a bachelor’s degree and 24 percent achieved an associate’s degree, compared to 6 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of low-arts, low-SES students</li>
                        <li> <strong>High-arts, low-SES students were more likely to register to vote than low-arts, low-SES students -- and all students</strong>: 78 percent of high-arts, low-SES students registered to vote, compared to 67 percent of low-arts, low-SES students -- and 76 percent of all students (though the latter difference was not statistically significant)</li>
                    </ol>

                        In 2017 a two-year study released this by researchers from the School of Social Policy & Practice at the University of Pennsylvania has revealed a quantitative relationship between the presence of cultural resources in a neighborhood and key aspects of social wellbeing, particularly in less advantaged neighborhoods. The research was part of the school’s ongoing Social Impact of the Arts Project (SIAP).
                        Professor Mark J. Stern and SIAP director Susan C. Seifert found that low- and middle-income residents across New York City with more access to cultural resources experience better education, security, and health outcomes compared to residents of neighborhoods with similar economic profiles but with fewer cultural resources. The research departs from previous studies by including the arts as “intrinsic” to residents’ having the freedom to live valuable lives, while also looking at its effect on other aspects of wellbeing.
                        <strong>When controlling for factors including economic status, race, and ethnicity, the relative higher presence of cultural resources in lower-income neighborhoods is linked with several health, safety, and education benefits. These include a 14% decrease in indicted investigations of child abuse and neglect, an 18% decrease in felony crime rate and also a 17–18% increase in the number of students scoring at the highest level on standardized Math and English tests.</strong>
